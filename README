Presentations
=============

This repo contains the slide decks for presentations that I've given over my
career.

For more recent presentations, I've been using LaTeX and Beamer to generate PDF
slide decks.  For older presentations, I've lost the original source, and have
just whatever PDFs I can find.

Most directories have a *.pdf file in them which is a “tagged” copy of the slide
deck.  There are also Makefiles that let you generate a “live” copy from each
one from the source.  You'll want to have a copy of TeX Live installed (package
group ‘texlive-most’ on Arch Linux).  Then just run ‘make’ in a particular
subdirectory to build just that slide deck, or ‘make’ in the top-level repo to
build everything.
